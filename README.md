#PROJECT WORK FLOW:-
1️⃣ Data Cleaning
Converted date column to datetime format.
Removed duplicates (~2% of data).
Handled missing values using median imputation.
Treated outliers using IQR-based Winsorization.

2️⃣ Feature Engineering
Extracted Year and Month from date.
Discretized:
Wind speed into categories (Very Low, Low, Medium, High)
Temperature into bins (Very Cold, Cold, Moderate, Hot)
Encoded categorical features using OneHotEncoding.
Standardized numerical variables using StandardScaler.

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis
Univariate Analysis: Histograms, Boxplots → distribution of power, wind speed, temperatures.
Bivariate Analysis:
Wind speed vs Power (clear positive correlation).
Failure vs Generator speed / temperature (failures more frequent at extreme values).
Multivariate Analysis:
Correlation Heatmap.
Pairplots for turbine variables.
Time Series Analysis:
Seasonal variations in power output.
Failures clustered in months with extreme temperatures.

4️⃣ Class Imbalance Check
Failures (Failure_status=1) represent only 8% of data → Imbalanced dataset.

#KEY METRICS  INSIGHTS:-
✔ Average Power Output: ~1200 kW
✔ Wind Speed vs Power Correlation: 0.85 (as expected from turbine physics)
✔ Failure Distribution:
Failures often occur when:
